create ship templates for simplified ship building
templates are readonly, taking in a Ship object and computing its construction cost
should be json serializable

add more features. building ships and stations?
economy?
warfare?

remove commented out shit, break code out into separate files




design decisions:

System is the zone subdivision in the game world. Galaxy may well be the shard subdivision, but maybe that should be Universe. TBD.
Octrees are centered on the star and the root node is big enough to contain all celestial objects for that system. Smaller subdivisions are added as needed when more objects are added to the tree.
One octree for asteroids, one for ships, one for stations? Planets and moons probably don't need to be in an octree. Maybe not even stations.


PROPULSION

fuel consumption: fuel consumption constant * sqrt(distance) * gross vehicle mass * (1 - 0.1 * research level)

maximum movement range per tick: range constant * 10 AU * units of propulsion equipped / gross vehicle mass
the range constant represents roughly the movement range of a default ship measured in AU

* note: at research level 11, fuel consumption is negative. I don't think that's a problem,
        I can probably just leave it as an easter egg for anyone who maxes out propulsion research.


RESEARCH

1 unit of research lab produces 0.001 research points (RP) per tick.
For each power of 10 RP accumulated in a given area of research (starting with 1 RP), a new technological level is unlocked.
Each level of research gives 10% boost to the technology it improves.

weapons: 10% damage
armor: 10% effective hit points (ships and stations)
propulsion: 10% less fuel consumption
manufacturing: 10% factory and refinery output
mining: 10% mining drone output
research: 10% research lab output
